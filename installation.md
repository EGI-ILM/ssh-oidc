## Installation

We provide packages for a large set of linux distribution (Debian, Ubuntu,
Centos, Rockylinux, OpenSuSE, Archlinux, ...) for client and server packages.

MacOS and Windows are additionally supported with client packages.

All packages (except MacOS currently) are available via
<https://repo.data.kit.edu>

The (optional) client-side packages (`oidc-agent` and `mccli`) are
additionally part of most Debian-, and Arch- based distributions
(`oidc-agent`) or easily installable via `pip install` (`mccli`).
